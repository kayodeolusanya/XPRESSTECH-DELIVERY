# XPRESSTECH-DELIVERY
Supply chain Analysis


XpressTech is a tech startup based in Lagos, Nigeria. The
startup launched as a ride hailing company in 2019,
before diversifying into Logistics and Food Delivery in
2020 after a ban on commercial motorcycles by the
Government of Lagos State. XpressTech took advantage
of this exemption and announced that it was diversifying
into package delivery using their existing motorcycles
and riders.

I was employed as a Supply Chain Analyst to
provide insight on food deliveries based on customer
preferences.
